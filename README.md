# From Crisis to Controversy: Refugees and the Rise of the Far Right in Bavaria

This project investigates whether the 2015 refugee crisis contributed to changes in far-right voting patterns in Bavaria, focusing on the electoral performance of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Using pre-crisis municipal characteristics and machine-learning–based feature selection, it constructs an exogenous proxy for local exposure to asylum seekers and evaluates its impact within a two-way fixed effects framework.

The analysis shows that higher exposure is associated with a *decrease* in AfD support—especially in smaller municipalities—while voter turnout remains largely unchanged. These findings suggest that direct local contact may mitigate rather than amplify far-right sentiment, challenging widely held assumptions about the political consequences of refugee inflows.

All source code used for the analysis is available in the `src` folder.  
- The main analysis is in **seminar.R**  
- The turnout analysis is in **turnout.R**  
- The procedure for obtaining church locations is in **church_location.R**

The full seminar report is provided in **seminar-report.pdf**.
